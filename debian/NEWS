atop (2.0.2-1bearstech1) stable; urgency=low

  This is a plain Debian packaging of atop 2.0.x series. It is based
  on the original Debian modification where logrotate is used to
  do the rotation at the usual 6:25 daily rotation time (which differs
  from atop's own scripts wich are based on 0:00 rotation times).

atop (1.13-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This new upstream release adds, among the usual bugfixes, recognition of
  thread-groups and scheduling information. The log-file format has changed to
  store the new information. This means that you can't read logs from the
  previous releases.
